Debugging in software engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs or defects in software code. Bugs are errors, flaws, or unintended behaviors in a program that cause it to produce incorrect or unexpected results. Debugging is an essential step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the software functions correctly and efficiently. ^33bbc0
